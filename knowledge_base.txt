In number theory, a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a "product" of two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime because the only ways of writing it as a product, 1 x 5 or 5 x 1, involve 5 itself.
